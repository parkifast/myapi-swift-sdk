# mymappi-swift-sdk
Swift SDK to ease interaction with mymappi API suite.

# Getting Started

You can get started with some examples just downloading the source code.

Add an entry to the Info.plist file of your project (or modify the Info.plist file of the example project) with the key MyapiToken and your api key as your value. You can find your api key in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.mymappi.com/). Remember that the mobile SDKs are not available for Starter plans.
